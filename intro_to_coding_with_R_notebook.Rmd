title: "Intro to coding with R"

This is an R Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Thinking of our R session as an empty factory, we first need to load some machines (functions). Run the code below (by pressing the green *play* arrow at the top right of the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*) to load the `tidyverse` library.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
Above we should see an indication that the `tidyverse` package was loaded. This gives us lots of great functions to work with. Let's use one of these functions to import some data into our R factory. Run the code chunk below:

```{r}
read_csv("HLA_haplotypes.csv")
```
